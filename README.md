# Resustyle

I created this app because I wanted a way to make my resume more modern and fresh.
I also wanted to be able to easily try different layouts for my resume on the fly.
Most importantly, I wanted to do it for free. This project was created in collaboration with
two excellent engineers byronxc and greggydeggy.

# Tech Used

React, i18next for multi-lingual support, FontAwesome react, Microsoft Fabric Components... more to come
